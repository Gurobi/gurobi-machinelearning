    "This model was developed in the context of the development of\n",

    "Machine Learning to integrate ML models and Mathematical Optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates in particular how to use the logistic regression and\n",
    "tune the piecewise-linear approximation of the logistic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also show how to deal with fixed features in the optimization model using\n",
    "pandas data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, data of students admissions in a college is used to predict the\n",
    "probability that a student enrolls to the college.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has 3 features: the SAT and GPA scores of each student, and the\n",
    "scholarship (or merit) that was offered to each student. Finally, it is known if\n",

    "(2020)</cite> proposes the following student enrollment problem. The Admission\n",
    "Office has data for SAT and GPA scores of the admitted students for the incoming\n",
    "class, and they would want to offer scholarships to students with the goal of\n",
    "maximizing the expected number of students that enroll in the college. There is\n",
    "a total of $n$ students that are admitted. The maximal budget for the sum of all\n",
    "scholarships offered is $0.2 n \\, \\text{K\\$}$ and each student can be offered a\n",
    "scholarship of at most $2.5 \\, \\text{K\\$}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be expressed as a mathematical optimization problem as follows.\n",
    "Two vectors of decision variables $x$ and $y$ of dimension $n$ are used to model\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = g(x_i, SAT_i, GPA_i), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $SAT_i$ and $GPA_i$ the (known) SAT and GPA score of each student.\n",

    "The objective is to maximize the sum of the $y$ variables and the budget\n",
    "constraint imposes that the sum of the variables $x$ is less or equal to $0.2n$.\n",
    "Also, each variable $x_i$ is between 0 and 2.5.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that in this example differently to <cite data-cite=\"JANOS\">Bergman et.al.\n",
