# Price Optimization

<div class="alert alert-info">
Note

This example is adapted from the example in Gurobi's modeling examples [How Much
Is Too Much? Avocado Pricing and Supply Using Mathematical
Optimization](https://github.com/Gurobi/modeling-examples/tree/master/price_optimization).

The main difference is that it uses `Scikit-learn` for the regression model and
Gurobi Machine Learning to embed the regression in a Gurobi model.

But it also differs in that it uses Matrix variables and that the interactive
part of the notebook is skipped. Please refer to the original example for this.

This example illustrates in particular how to use categorical variables in a
regression.

If you are already familiar with the example from the other notebook, you can
jump directly to [building the regression model](#Part-II:-Predict-the-Sales)
and then to [formulating the optimization
problem](#Part-III:-Optimize-for-Price-and-Supply-of-Avocados).
</div>

A [Food Network
article](https://www.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/news/2018/3/avocado-unseats-banana-as-america-s-top-fruit-import-by-value)
from March 2017 declared, "Avocado unseats banana as America's top fruit
import." This declaration is incomplete and debatable for reasons other than
whether  avocado is a fruit. Avocados are expensive.

As a supplier, setting an appropriate avocado price requires a delicate
trade-off. Set it too high and you lose customers. Set it too low, and you won't
make a profit. Equipped with good data, the avocado pricing and supply problem
is *ripe* with opportunities for demonstrating the power of optimization and
data science.

They say when life gives you avocados, make guacamole. Just like the perfect
guacamole needs the right blend of onion, lemon and spices, finding an optimal
avocado price needs the right blend of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive
analytics.

**Goal**: Develop a data science pipeline for pricing and distribution of
avocados to maximize revenue.

This notebook walks through a decision-making pipeline that culminates in a
mathematical optimization model. There are three stages:

- First, understand the dataset and infer the relationships between categories
  such as the sales, price, region, and seasonal trends.
- Second, build a prediction model that predicts the demand for avocados as a
  function of price, region, year and the seasonality.
- Third, design an optimization problem that sets the optimal price and supply
  quantity to maximize the net revenue while incorporating costs for wastage and
  transportation.

+++

## Load the Packages and the Datasets

We use real sales data provided by the [Hass Avocado
Board](https://hassavocadoboard.com/) (HAB), whose aim is to "make avocados
Americaâ€™s most popular fruit". This dataset contains consolidated information on
several years' worth of market prices and sales of avocados.

We will now load the following packages for analyzing and visualizing the data.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import warnings

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import tree
import seaborn as sns
import sklearn
import numpy as np
```

The dataset from HAB contains sales data for the years 2019-2022. This data is
augmented by a previous download from HAB available on
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timmate/avocado-prices-2020) with sales
for the years 2015-2018.

Each row in the dataset is the weekly number of avocados sold and the weekly
average price of an avocado categorized by region and type of avocado. There are
two types of avocados: conventional and organic. In this notebook, we will only
consider the conventional avocados. There are eight large regions, namely the
Great Lakes, Midsouth, North East, Northern New England, South Central, South
East, West and Plains.

Now, load the data and store into a Pandas dataframe.

```{code-cell} ipython3
data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gurobi/modeling-examples/master/price_optimization/"
avocado = pd.read_csv(
    data_url + "HABdata_2019_2022.csv"
)  # dataset downloaded directly from HAB
avocado_old = pd.read_csv(
    data_url + "kaggledata_till2018.csv"
)  # dataset downloaded from Kaggle
avocado = pd.concat([avocado, avocado_old])
avocado
```

## Prepare the Dataset

We will now prepare the data for making sales predictions. Add new columns to
the dataframe for the year and seasonality. Let each year from 2015 through 2022
be given an index from 0 through 7 in the increasing order of the year. We will
define the peak season to be the months of February through July. These months
are set based on visual inspection of the trends, but you can try setting other
months.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Add the index for each year from 2015 through 2022
avocado["date"] = pd.to_datetime(avocado["date"])
avocado["year"] = pd.DatetimeIndex(avocado["date"]).year
avocado = avocado.sort_values(by="date")

# Define the peak season
avocado["month"] = pd.DatetimeIndex(avocado["date"]).month
peak_months = range(2, 8)  # <--------- Set the months for the "peak season"


def peak_season(row):
    return 1 if int(row["month"]) in peak_months else 0


avocado["peak"] = avocado.apply(lambda row: peak_season(row), axis=1)

# Scale the number of avocados to millions
avocado["units_sold"] = avocado["units_sold"] / 1000000

# Select only conventional avocados
avocado = avocado[avocado["type"] == "Conventional"]

avocado = avocado[
    ["date", "units_sold", "price", "region", "year", "month", "peak"]
].reset_index(drop=True)

avocado
```

## Part 1: Observe Trends in the Data

Now, we will infer sales trends in time and seasonality. For simplicity, let's
proceed with data from the United States as a whole.

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_Total_US = avocado[avocado["region"] == "Total_US"]
```

### Sales Over the Years

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 5))

mean = df_Total_US.groupby("year")["units_sold"].mean()
std = df_Total_US.groupby("year")["units_sold"].std()
axes.errorbar(mean.index, mean, xerr=0.5, yerr=2 * std, linestyle="")
axes.set_ylabel("Units Sold (millions)")
axes.set_xlabel("Year")

fig.tight_layout()
```

We can see that the sales generally increased over the years, albeit marginally.
The dip in 2019 is the effect of the well-documented [2019 avocado
shortage](https://abc7news.com/avocado-shortage-season-prices/5389855/) that led
to avocados [nearly doubling in
price.](https://abc7news.com/avocado-shortage-season-prices/5389855/)

+++

### Seasonality

We will now see the sales trends within a year.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 5))

mean = df_Total_US.groupby("month")["units_sold"].mean()
std = df_Total_US.groupby("month")["units_sold"].std()

axes.errorbar(mean.index, mean, xerr=0.5, yerr=2 * std, linestyle="")
axes.set_ylabel("Units Sold (millions)")
axes.set_xlabel("Month")

fig.tight_layout()

plt.xlabel("Month")
axes.set_xticks(range(1, 13))
plt.ylabel("Units sold (millions)")
plt.show()
```

We see a Super Bowl peak in February and a Cinco de Mayo peak in May.

+++

### Correlations

Now, we will see how the variables are correlated with each other. The end goal
is to predict sales given the price of an avocado, year and seasonality (peak or
not).

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=(15, 5))
sns.heatmap(
    df_Total_US[["units_sold", "price", "year", "peak"]].corr(),
    annot=True,
    center=0,
    ax=axes,
)

axes.set_title("Correlations for conventional avocados")
plt.show()
```

As expected, the sales quantity has a negative correlation with the price per
avocado. The sales quantity has a positive correlation with the year and season
being a peak season.

+++

### Regions

Finally, we will see how the sales differ among the different regions. This will
determine the number of avocados that we want to supply to each region.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 5))

regions = [
    "Great_Lakes",
    "Midsouth",
    "Northeast",
    "Northern_New_England",
    "SouthCentral",
    "Southeast",
    "West",
    "Plains",
]
df = avocado[avocado.region.isin(regions)]

mean = df.groupby("region")["units_sold"].mean()
std = df.groupby("region")["units_sold"].std()

axes.errorbar(range(len(mean)), mean, xerr=0.5, yerr=2 * std, linestyle="")

fig.tight_layout()

plt.xlabel("Region")
plt.xticks(range(len(mean)), pd.DataFrame(mean)["units_sold"].index, rotation=20)
plt.ylabel("Units sold (millions)")
plt.show()
```

Clearly, west-coasters love avocados.

+++

## Part II: Predict the Sales

The trends observed in Part I motivate us to construct a prediction model for
sales using the independent variables- price, year, region and seasonality.
Henceforth, the sales quantity will be referred to as the *predicted demand*.

+++

To validate the regression model, we will randomly split the dataset into $80\%$
training and $20\%$ testing data and learn the weights using `Scikit-learn`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df[["region", "price", "year", "peak"]]
y = df["units_sold"]
# Split the data for training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, train_size=0.8, random_state=1
)
```

Note that the region is a categorical variable.

To apply a linear regression, we need to transform those variable using an encoding. Here we use Scikit Learn `OneHotEncoder`. We also use a standard scaler for prices and year index. All those transformations are combined with a `Column Transformer` built using `make_column_transformer`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer

feat_transform = make_column_transformer(
    (OneHotEncoder(drop="first"), ["region"]),
    (StandardScaler(), ["price", "year"]),
    ("passthrough", ["peak"]),
    verbose_feature_names_out=False,
    remainder='drop'
)
```

The regression model is a pipeline consisting of the `Column Transformer` we just defined and a Linear Regression.

Define it and train it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

lin_reg = make_pipeline(feat_transform, LinearRegression())
lin_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get R^2 from test data
y_pred = lin_reg.predict(X_test)
print(f"The R^2 value in the test set is {r2_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
```

We can observe a good $R^2$ value in the test set. We will now train the fit the
weights to the full dataset.

```{code-cell} ipython3
lin_reg.fit(X, y)

y_pred_full = lin_reg.predict(X)
print(f"The R^2 value in the full dataset is {r2_score(y, y_pred_full)}")
```

## Part III: Optimize for Price and Supply of Avocados

+++

Knowing how the price of an avocado affects the demand, how can we set the
optimal avocado price? We don't want to set the price too high, since that could
drive demand and sales down. At the same time, setting the price too low could
be suboptimal when maximizing revenue. So what is the sweet spot?

On the distribution logistics, we want to make sure that there are enough
avocados across the regions. We can address these considerations in a
mathematical optimization model. An optimization model finds the **best
solution** according to an **objective function** such that the solution
satisfies a set of **constraints**. Here, a solution is expressed as a vector of
real values or integer values called **decision variables**. Constraints are a
set of equations or inequalities written as a function of the decision
variables.

At the start of each week, assume that the total number of available products is
finite. This quantity needs to be distributed to the various regions while
maximizing net revenue. So there are two key decisions - the price of an avocado
in each region, and the number of avocados allocated to each region.

Let us now define some input parameters and notations used for creating the
model. The subscript $r$ will be used to denote each region.

### Input Parameters
- $R$: set of regions,
- $d(p,r)$: predicted demand in region $r\in R$ when the avocado per product is
  $p$,
- $B$: available avocados to be distributed across the regions,
- $c_{waste}$: cost ($\$$) per wasted avocado,
- $c^r_{transport}$: cost ($\$$) of transporting a avocado to region $r \in R$,
- $a^r_{min},a^r_{max}$: minimum and maximum price ($\$$) per avocado for reigon
  $r \in R$,
- $b^r_{min},b^r_{max}$: minimum and maximum number of avocados allocated to
  region $r \in R$,

The following code loads the Gurobi python package and initiates the
optimization model. The value of $B$ is set to $30$ million avocados, which is
close to the average weekly supply value from the data. For illustration, let us
consider the peak season of 2021. The cost of wasting an avocado is set to
$\$0.10$. The cost of transporting an avocado ranges between $\$0.10$ to
$\$0.50$ based on each region's distance from the southern border, where the
[majority of avocado supply comes
from](https://www.britannica.com/plant/avocado). Further, we can set the price
of an avocado to not exceed $\$ 2$ apiece.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Note

There are subtle but significant differences in the model with respect to the original notebook.

Here, we use Gurobi matrix variables API instead of variables indexed by the
regions. Our variables are then vectors and matrices and are not indexed by
regions (they are just indexed by their row and column numbers).

Because of this, we have to make certain that the data is always presented with
the regions in the exact same order. We repeatedly use `.loc[regions]` on the
data stored in pandas to make sure of that.

</div>

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Sets and parameters
B = 30  # total amount ot avocado supply

peak_or_not = 1  # 1 if it is the peak season; 1 if isn't
year = 2022

c_waste = 0.1  # the cost ($) of wasting an avocado

# the cost of transporting an avocado
c_transport = pd.Series(
    {
        "Great_Lakes": 0.3,
        "Midsouth": 0.1,
        "Northeast": 0.4,
        "Northern_New_England": 0.5,
        "SouthCentral": 0.3,
        "Southeast": 0.2,
        "West": 0.2,
        "Plains": 0.2,
    }, name='transport_cost'
)

c_transport = c_transport.loc[regions]
# the cost of transporting an avocado

# Get the lower and upper bounds from the dataset for the price and the number of products to be stocked
a_min = 0  # minimum avocado price in each region
a_max = 2  # maximum avocado price in each region

data = pd.concat([c_transport,
                  df.groupby("region")["units_sold"].min().rename('min_delivery'),
                  df.groupby("region")["units_sold"].max().rename('max_delivery')], axis=1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
data
```

### Create dataframe for the fixed features of the regression

We now start creating the input of the regression in the optimization models with the features that are fixed.

We use gurobipy-pandas that help to more easily create gurobipy models using pandas data.

+++

First, create a dataframe with the features that are fixed in our optimization problem.
It is indexed by the regions (we want to use one regression to predict demand for each region) and has the 3
columns corresponding to the fixed features:

* `year`
* `peak` with the value of `peak_or_not`
* `region` that repeat the names of the regions.

Display the dataframe to make sure it is correct

```{code-cell} ipython3
import gurobipy_pandas as gppd
feats = pd.DataFrame(
    data={
        "year": year,
        "peak": peak_or_not,
        "region": regions,
    },
    index=regions
)
feats
```

### Decision Variables

Let us now define the decision variables. In our model, we want to store the
price and number of avocados allocated to each region. We also want variables
that track how many avocados are predicted to be sold and how many are predicted
to be wasted. The following notation is used to model these decision variables.

$p$ the price of an avocado ($\$$) in each region,

$x$ the number of avocados supplied to each region,

$s$ the predicted number of avocados sold in each region,

$w$ the predicted number of avocados wasted in each region.

$d$ the predicted demand in each region.

All those variables are created using gurobipy-pandas, with the function `gppd.add_vars` they are given the same index as the `data` dataframe.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import gurobipy as gp

m = gp.Model("Avocado_Price_Allocation")

p = gppd.add_vars(m, data, name="price", lb=a_min, ub=a_max)
x = gppd.add_vars(m, data, name="x", lb='min_delivery', ub='max_delivery')
s = gppd.add_vars(m, data, name="s") # predicted amount of sales in each region for the given price).
w = gppd.add_vars(m, data, name="w") # excess wasteage in each region).
d = gppd.add_vars(m, data, lb=-gp.GRB.INFINITY, name="demand") # Add variables for the regression

m.update()

# Display one of the variables
p
```

### Set the Objective

Next, we will define the objective function: we want to maximize the **net
revenue**. The revenue from sales in each region is calculated by the price of
an avocado in that region multiplied by the quantity sold there. There are two
types of costs incurred: the wastage costs for excess unsold avocados and the
cost of transporting the avocados to the different regions.

The net revenue is the sales revenue subtracted by the total costs incurred. We
assume that the purchase costs are fixed and are not incorporated in this model.

Using the defined decision variables, the objective can be written as follows.

\begin{align} \textrm{maximize} &  \sum_{r}  (p_r * s_r - c_{waste} * w_r -
c^r_{transport} * x_r)& \end{align}

Let us now add the objective function to the model.

```{code-cell} ipython3
m.setObjective((p * s).sum() - c_waste * w.sum() - (c_transport * x).sum(),
               gp.GRB.MAXIMIZE)
```

### Add the Supply Constraint

We now introduce the constraints. The first constraint is to make sure that the
total number of avocados supplied is equal to $B$, which can be mathematically
expressed as follows.

\begin{align*} \sum_{r} x_r &= B \end{align*}

The following code adds this constraint to the model.

```{code-cell} ipython3
m.addConstr(x.sum() == B)
m.update()
```

### Add Constraints That Define Sales Quantity

Next, we should define the predicted sales quantity in each region. We can
assume that if we supply more than the predicted demand, we sell exactly the
predicted demand. Otherwise, we sell exactly the allocated amount. Hence, the
predicted sales quantity is the minimum of the allocated quantity and the
predicted demand, i.e., $s_r = \min \{x_r,d_r(p_r)\}$. This relationship can be
modeled by the following two constraints for each region $r$.

\begin{align*} s_r &\leq x_r  \\
s_r &\leq d(p_r,r) \end{align*}

These constraints will ensure that the sales quantity $s_r$ in region $r$ is
greater than neither the allocated quantity nor the predicted demand. Note that
the maximization objective function tries to maximize the revenue from sales,
and therefore the optimizer will maximize the predicted sales quantity. This is
assuming that the surplus and transportation costs are less than the sales price
per avocado. Hence, these constraints along with the objective will ensure that
the sales are equal to the minimum of supply and predicted demand.

Let us now add these constraints to the model.

In this case, we use gurobipy-pandas, add_constrs function

```{code-cell} ipython3
gppd.add_constrs(m, s, gp.GRB.LESS_EQUAL, x)
gppd.add_constrs(m, s, gp.GRB.LESS_EQUAL, d)
m.update()
```

### Add the Wastage Constraints

Finally, we should define the predicted wastage in each region, given by the
supplied quantity that is not predicted to be sold. We can express this
mathematically for each region $r$.

\begin{align*} w_r &= x_r - s_r \end{align*}

We can add these constraints to the model.

```{code-cell} ipython3
gppd.add_constrs(m, w, gp.GRB.EQUAL, x - s)
m.update()
```

### Add the constraints to predict demand

+++

First, we create our full input for the predictor constraint. We concated the `p` variables and the fixed features

```{code-cell} ipython3
feats = pd.concat([feats, p], axis=1)[["region", "price", "year", "peak"]]


feats
```

Now, we just need to call
[add_predictor_constr](../api/AbstractPredictorConstr.rst#gurobi_ml.add_predictor_constr)
to insert the constraints linking the features and the demand.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from gurobi_ml import add_predictor_constr
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pred_constr = add_predictor_constr(m, lin_reg, feats, d)

pred_constr.print_stats()
```

### Fire Up the Solver

We have added the decision variables, objective function, and the constraints to
the model. The model is ready to be solved. Before we do so, we should let the
solver know what type of model this is. The default setting assumes that the
objective and the constraints are linear functions of the variables.

In our model, the objective is **quadratic** since we take the product of price
and the predicted sales, both of which are variables. Maximizing a quadratic
term is said to be **non-convex**, and we specify this by setting the value of
the [Gurobi NonConvex
parameter](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/nonconvex.html) to be
$2$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
m.Params.NonConvex = 2
m.optimize()
```

The solver solved the optimization problem in less than a second. Let us now
analyze the optimal solution by storing it in a Pandas dataframe.

```{code-cell} ipython3
solution = pd.DataFrame(index=regions)

solution["Price"] = p.gppd.X
solution["Allocated"] = x.gppd.X
solution["Sold"] = s.gppd.X
solution["Wasted"] = w.gppd.X
solution["Pred_demand"] = d.gppd.X

opt_revenue = m.ObjVal
print("\n The optimal net revenue: $%f million" % opt_revenue)
solution.round(4)
```

We can also check the error in the estimate of the Gurobi solution for the regression model.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(
    "Maximum error in approximating the regression {:.6}".format(
        np.max(pred_constr.get_error())
    )
)
```

And the computed features of the regression model in a pandas dataframe.

```{code-cell} ipython3
pred_constr.input_values.drop('region', axis=1)
```

Let us now visualize a scatter plot between the price and the number of avocados
sold (in millions) for the eight regions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)

plot_sol = sns.scatterplot(data=solution, x="Price", y="Sold", hue=solution.index, s=100)
plot_waste = sns.scatterplot(
    data=solution, x="Price", y="Wasted", marker="x", hue=solution.index, s=100, legend=False
)

plot_sol.legend(loc="center left", bbox_to_anchor=(1.25, 0.5), ncol=1)
plot_waste.legend(loc="center left", bbox_to_anchor=(1.25, 0.5), ncol=1)
plt.ylim(0, 5)
plt.xlim(1, 2.2)
ax.set_xlabel("Price per avocado ($)")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of avocados sold (millions)")
plt.show()
print(
    "The circles represent sales quantity and the cross markers represent the wasted quantity."
)
```

We have shown how to model the price and supply optimization problem with Gurobi
Machine Learning. In the [Gurobi modeling examples
notebook](https://github.com/Gurobi/modeling-examples/tree/master/price_optimization)
more analysis of the solutions this model can give is done interactively. Be
sure to take look at it.
