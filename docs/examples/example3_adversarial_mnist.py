Adversarial Machine Learning
============================

In this example, we show how to use Gurobi Machine Learning to construct
an adversarial example for a trained neural network.

We use the MNIST handwritten digit database
(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for this example.

For this problem, we are given a trained neural network and one well
classified example :math:`\bar x`. Our goal is to construct another
example :math:`x` *close to* :math:`\bar x` that is classified with a
different label.

For the hand digit recognition problem, the input is a grayscale image
of :math:`28 \times 28` (:math:`=784`) pixels and the output is a vector
of length 10 (each entry corresponding to a digit). We denote the output
vector by :math:`y`. The image is classified according to the largest
entry of :math:`y`.

For the training example, assume that coordinate :math:`l` of the output
vector is the one with the largest value giving the correct label. We
pick a coordinate corresponding to another label, denoted :math:`w`, and
we want the difference between :math:`y_w - y_l` to be as large as
possible.

If we can find a solution where this difference is positive, then
:math:`x` is a *counter-example* receiving a different label. If instead
we can show that the difference is never positive, no such example
exists.

Here, we use the :math:`l_1-` norm :math:`|| x - \bar x||_1` to define
the neighborhood with its size defined by a fixed parameter
:math:`\delta`:

.. math::  || x - \bar x ||_1 \le \delta.

Denoting by :math:`g` the prediction function of the neural network, the
full optimization model reads:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   &\max y_w - y_l \\
   &\text{subject to:}\\
   &|| x - \bar x ||_1 \le \delta,\\\
   & y = g(x).
   \end{aligned}

Note that our model is inspired by Fischet al. (2018).

Imports and loading data
------------------------

First, we import the required packages for this example.

In addition to the usual packages, we will need ``matplotlib`` to plot
the digits, and ``joblib`` to load a pre-trained network and part of the
training data.

import gurobipy as gp
import numpy as np
from joblib import load
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

from gurobi_ml import add_predictor_constr

######################################################################
# We load a neural network that was pre-trained with Scikit-learn’s
# MLPClassifier. The network is small (2 hidden layers of 50 neurons),
# finding a counter example shouldn’t be too difficult.
#
# We also load the first 100 training examples of the MNIST dataset that
# we saved to avoid having to reload the full data set.
#

# Load the trained network and the examples
mnist_data = load("../../tests/predictors/mnist__mlpclassifier.joblib")
nn = mnist_data["predictor"]
X = mnist_data["data"]


######################################################################
# Choose an example and set labels
# --------------------------------
#
# Now we choose an example. Here we chose arbitrarily example 26. We plot
# the example and verify if it is well predicted by calling the
# ``predict`` function.
#

# Choose an example
exampleno = 26
example = X[exampleno : exampleno + 1, :]

plt.imshow(example.reshape((28, 28)), cmap="gray")

print(f"Predicted label {nn.predict(example)}")


######################################################################
# To set up the objective function of the optimization model, we also need
# to find a wrong label.
#
# We use ``predict_proba`` to get the weight given by the neural network
# to each label. We then use ``numpy``\ ’s ``argsort`` function to get the
# labels sorted by their weight. The right label is then the last element
# in the list, and we pick the next to last element as the wrong label.
#

ex_prob = nn.predict_proba(example)
sorted_labels = np.argsort(ex_prob)[0]
right_label = sorted_labels[-1]
wrong_label = sorted_labels[-2]


######################################################################
# Building the optimization model
# -------------------------------
#
# Now all the data is gathered, and we proceed to building the
# optimization model.
#
# We create a matrix variable ``x`` corresponding to the new input of the
# neural network we want to compute and a ``y`` matrix variable for the
# output of the neural network. Those variables should have respectively
# the shape of the example we picked and the shape of the return value of
# ``predict_proba``.
#
# We need additional variables to model the :math:`l1-`\ norm constraint.
# Namely, for each pixel in the image, we need to measure the absolute
# difference between :math:`x` and :math:`\bar x`. The corresponding
# matrix variable has the same shape as ``x``.
#
# We set the objective which is to maximize the difference between the
# *wrong* label and the *right* label.
#

m = gp.Model()
delta = 5

x = m.addMVar(example.shape, lb=0.0, ub=1.0, name="x")
y = m.addMVar(ex_prob.shape, lb=-gp.GRB.INFINITY, name="y")

abs_diff = m.addMVar(example.shape, lb=0, ub=1, name="abs_diff")

m.setObjective(y[0, wrong_label] - y[0, right_label], gp.GRB.MAXIMIZE)


######################################################################
# The :math:`l1-`\ norm constraint is formulated with:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \eta \ge x - \bar x \\
#    \eta \ge \bar x - x \\
#    \sum \eta \le \delta
#
# With :math:`\eta` denoting the ``absdiff`` variables.
#
# Those constraints are naturally expressed with Gurobi’s Matrix API.
#

# Bound on the distance to example in norm-1
m.addConstr(abs_diff >= x - example)
m.addConstr(abs_diff >= -x + example)
m.addConstr(abs_diff.sum() <= delta)

# Update the model
m.update()


######################################################################
# Finally, we insert the neural network in the ``gurobipy`` model to link
# ``x`` and ``y``.
#
# Note that this case is not as straightforward as others. The reason is
# that the neural network is trained for classification with a
# ``"softmax"`` activation in the last layer. But in this model we don't
# need the values of softmax and can just use identity for the last layer.
#
# For this reason, we change manually the last layer activation before
# adding the network to the Gurobi model.
#
# In the output, there is a warning about adding constraints with very
# small coefficients that are ignored. Neural-networks often contain very
# small coefficients in their expressions. Any coefficient with an
# absolute value smaller than :math:`10^{-13}` is ignored by Gurobi. This
# may result in slightly different predicted values but should be
# negligible.
#

# Code to add the neural network to the constraints
pred_constr = add_predictor_constr(m, nn, x, y, predict_function="identity")

######################################################################
# The model should be complete. We print the statistics of what was added
# to insert the neural network into the optimization model.
#

pred_constr.print_stats()


######################################################################
# Solving the model
# -----------------
#
# We now turn to solving the optimization model. Solving the adversarial
# problem, as we formulated it above, doesn’t actually require computing a
# provably optimal solution. Instead, we need to either:
#
# -  find a feasible solution with a positive objective cost (i.e. a
#    counter-example), or
# -  prove that there is no solution of positive cost (i.e. no
#    counter-example in the neighborhood exists).
#
# We can use Gurobi parameters to limit the optimization to answer those
# questions: setting
# `BestObjStop <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/bestobjstop.html#parameter:BestObjStop>`__
# to 0.0 will stop the optimizer if a counter-example is found, setting
# `BestBdStop <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/bestobjstop.html#parameter:BestBdStop>`__
# to 0.0 will stop the optimization if the optimizer has shown there is no
# counter-example.
#
# We set the two parameters and optimize.
#

m.Params.BestBdStop = 0.0
m.Params.BestObjStop = 0.0
m.optimize()


######################################################################
# Results
# -------
#
# Normally, for the example and :math:`\delta` we chose, a counter example
# that gets the wrong label is found. We finish this notebook by plotting
# the counter example and printing how it is classified by the neural
# network.
#

plt.imshow(x.X.reshape((28, 28)), cmap="gray")

print(f"Solution is classified as {nn.predict(x.X)}")
