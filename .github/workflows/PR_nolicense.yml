# This workflow uses `pull_request` which does not have access to a WLS license, it is just safer to use
# and will be started for any newly opened PRs or when a change is pushed to the PR.
#
# Since the WLS license is missing, this workflow runs a limited set of tests:
# - It skips the examples target in tox,
# - In pytest, some tests are annotated as needing a WLS license. These are automatically skipped.
