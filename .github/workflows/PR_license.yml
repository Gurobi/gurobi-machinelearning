# This workflow uses `pull_request_target` which has access to a WLS license. For security reasons, this workflow
# will only be run for PRs from a fork after it has been assessed by a repository owner and has the "safe to test"
# label added. Any changes to the PR in need of a retriggering of the workflow require the removal and re-adding of the
# "safe to test" label.
#
# Since a subset of tests was already run in the nolicense workflow, this workflow runs skips the following tests:
# - Lint with flake8.
