Gurobi Machine learning
==================================

A Python package to help use trained regression models in
mathematical optimization models. The package supports a variety of regression models
(linear, logistic, neural networks, decision trees,...) trained by
different machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, Keras and PyTorch).

See https://gurobi-optimization-gurobi-machine-learning.readthedocs-hosted.com/
