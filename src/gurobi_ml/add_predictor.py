    """Use `predictor` to predict the value of `output_vars` using `input_vars` in `model`

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: `gp.Model <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/py_model.html>`_
            The gurobipy model where the predictor should be inserted.
    predictor:
        The predictor to insert.
    input_vars: mvar_array_like
        Decision variables used as input for predictor in model.
    output_vars: mvar_array_like, optional
        Decision variables used as output for predictor in model.

    Returns
    -------
    AbstractPredictorConstr
        Object containing information about what was added to model to insert the
        predictor in it

    Note
    ----
    The parameters `input_vars` and `output_vars` can be either

     * Gurobipy matrix variables `gp.MVar <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/py_mvar.html>`_
     * Lists of variables
     * Dictionaries of variables

    For internal use in the package they are cast into matrix variables and it is
    the preferred and most convenient format to use.

    They should have dimensions that conforms with the input/output of the predictor.
    We denote by `n_features` the dimension of the input of the predictor and by `n_output` the dimension of the output.

    If they are lists or a dictionaries `input_vars` should have length `n_features` and `output_vars`
    should have length `n_output`.

    If they are matrix variables, `input_vars` and `output_vars` can be either of shape `(n_features)` and
    `(n_outputs,)` respectively or `(k, n_features)` and `(k, n_outputs)` respectively (with `k >= 1`).
    The latter form is especially useful if the predictor is used to associate different groups of
    variables (e.g. a prediction is made for every time period in a planning horizon).
